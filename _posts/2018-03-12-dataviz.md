## Some resources on data visualization

- A very useful course on data visualization for journalistz from UC Berkley I've been reading through. A good intro and lots o resources for additional reading. Gives a structure for geting into the topic.

- A blog by Lisa Charlotte Rost

- Found the prvious blog through this post on different visualization tools:

- Another course on infographics, on Coursera from Michigan State University: https://www.coursera.org/learn/infographic-design/lecture/pKZF4/video-the-importance-of-sketching


I'm very much in the beginning of this topic but it has already made me finally familiarize myself with github and version control and is direclty a reason for starting yet another blog - this one and has branched into learning the static site generator Jekyll (which I'm using for this blog). I love how things branch out like that.
