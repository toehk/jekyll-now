title: Some resources on data visualization
---
I've long been interested in data visualization. Both as part of contemporary communications (social media) work but also in general. Now, having a bit of time, I've started reading up on this topic and have discovered some useful resources.

Here's a starter list:

- A very useful course on data visualization for journalistz from UC Berkley I've been reading through. A good intro and lots o resources for additional reading. Gives a structure for geting into the topic.

- A blog by Lisa Charlotte Rost
<https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/>

- Found the prvious blog through this post on different visualization tools:
<https://source.opennews.org/articles/what-i-learned-recreating-one-chart-using-24-tools/>

- Another course on infographics, on Coursera from Michigan State University: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/infographic-design/lecture/pKZF4/video-the-importance-of-sketching>


I'm very much in the beginning of this topic but it has already made me finally familiarize myself with github and version control and is directly a reason for starting yet another blog - this one and has branched into learning the static site generator Jekyll (which I'm using for this blog). I love how things branch out like that.
